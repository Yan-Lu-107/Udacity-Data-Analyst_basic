# Udacity--Project-Investigate-TMDB-Movies-Dataset


# Project Overview
In this project, I have to analyze a dataset and then communicate my findings about it. I will use the Python libraries NumPy, pandas, and Matplotlib to nvestigate the relationship between multiple variables in the data set. For example, What are the most popular movie categories each year? What are the characteristics of movies with high box office?

This data set of TMDB-Movies contains 10,000 pieces of movie information. The source of the information is the "movie database" (TMDb, The Movie Database), including user ratings and box office. Data columns such as "cast" and "genres" contain multiple values separated by a vertical bar character (|). There are some strange characters in the "cast" column. The last two columns ending with "_adj" indicate the budget and income of the relevant movie after taking into account inflation (calculated in 2010 dollars).

# What I have learn?
After completing the project, I have learned following :

Know all the steps involved in a typical data analysis process
Be comfortable posing questions that can be answered with a given dataset and then answering those questions
Know how to investigate problems in a dataset and wrangle the data into a format you can use
Have practice communicating the results of your analysis
Be able to use vectorized operations in NumPy and pandas to speed up your data analysis code
Be familiar with pandas' Series and DataFrame objects, which let you access your data more conveniently
Know how to use Matplotlib to produce plots showing your findings
